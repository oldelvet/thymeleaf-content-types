Demonstrate the content types and character sets that Thymeleaf attaches
to requests.

In particular post 3.0.6 release the content negotiation seems to be
guided by the file extension in the URL and ignores the type of any
templates that are used to generate the output.

The main use case that I am interested in is for catching 404 NotFound
requests where a prefix of the path does not correspond to a valid
item in the database. When this happens for a path that would
normally generate JSON, XML or similar output the content type of the
error page is listed as JSON, XML etc and not as the proper HTML
template that I would like to generate.
